    - every hour a Lo's hp is decreased by 10.. he is lonely af 
- If an owner goes 6 hours without feeding its Lo (essentially "gardening") 
    - a few trees are cut down (random out of 5) with an :( message => "Without your help, Lo's garden ran low on supplies (he IS feeding a forest) and he had to eat store bought meat.. # tress are cutdown for cattle production.. the number one contributor for climate change"
